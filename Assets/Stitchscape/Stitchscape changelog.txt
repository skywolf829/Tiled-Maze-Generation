Stitchscape Release Notes
-------------------------

Stitchscape 2.0

Additions:
	• Blend strength slider, which controls how much detail is preserved when stitching.

Changes:
	• Stitch width slider changed from absolute numbers to a percentage.
	• Found a way to have the newer undo system work with terrain data without freezing, so the Undo.RegisterUndo deprecation warning is removed in Unity 5.0 and later.
	• Improved documentation.

-----------

Stitchscape 1.5.2

Changes:
	• Switched to GUI instead of GUILayout since layout issues keep happening with different Unity releases.
	• Stitchscape is accessed through the GameObject menu now (GameObject -> Stitch Terrains...) and has a keyboard shortcut (alt-shift-T).

-----------

Stitchscape 1.5.1

Changes:
	• Fixed minor editor window layout issue when using Unity 3.5 or higher.

-----------

Stitchscape 1.5

Additions:
	• "Autofill from scene" button, which will set up the terrain stitching grid without any drag'n'drop needed, based on the terrains existing in the current scene.

Changes:
	• Requires Unity 3.4 or later.
	• Drag'n'drop to the terrain stitching grid works from the hierarchy instead of from the project.

Fixes:
	• Fixed code warning when running Unity 3.4.
	• Stitch width is prevented from going below 2 (has no effect if it's 1).

-----------

Stitchscape 1.4

Changes:
	• Added code to prevent errors being printed if Stitchscape is running in play mode.
	• Added Z and X axes to the terrain grid, to make it more clear how terrains should be arranged.

-----------

Stitchscape 1.3

Changes:
	• Setting the terrain grid to 1x1 will make a single terrain repeatable with itself.

-----------

Stitchscape 1.2

Changes:
	• Stitch width is now a maximum of half of the terrain resolution, instead of 100 (which was just arbitrary).

-----------

Stitchscape 1.1

Changes:
	• Works properly with Unity 3.0.

-----------

Stitchscape 1.0

Initial release.
