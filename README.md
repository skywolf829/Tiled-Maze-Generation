# Tiled-Maze-Generation
In the fall of 2016, I joined OSU's Graphics Research team. This is the first research that I'm working on as a 2nd year undergraduate.

This research was originally intended to extend the implementation of Paul Kim's research on a Perfect perfect-maze (see http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7272964/?arnumber=7272964&tag=1). The end goal of his research is to create two bit vectors that correspond to a specific spanning tree. My objective is to use those bit vectors and create a generated game world inside of Unity.
